# AIVascularSegmentation

train_mrcc - file to train a Mask R-CNN algorithm to segment the CA and IJV from neck US images. The data used to train can be found under the PARTITION FOR CROSS-VALIDATION, this provides the start and end locations for a four-fold cross validation. 

train_unet - file to train a U-Net algorithm to segment the CA and IJV from neck US images. The data used to train can be found under the PARTITION FOR CROSS-VALIDATION, this provides the start and end locations for a four-fold cross validation. 

test_mrcnn and test_unet - files to run to obtain test results 

Unet - file that executes the U-net segmentation algorithm.
